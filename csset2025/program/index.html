                Title: Examining Problems in Database Migration Through Bin Packing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Abstract: The database migration problem entails the movement of data between different databases. Such migration is often necessary due to database software updates or from changes to hardware, project standards, and other business factors. This is a pervasive issue in cloud computing clusters, where a pay-per-use infrastructure and unpredictable workloads necessitate frequent allocation and movement of data. Thus, there is a pressing need for efficient procedures to minimize the resource overhead involved in data migration. This interest has also been fueled in recent years by the massive generation of data in what is now being called the Big Data age. Consequently, there has been a proliferation of resource-intensive data centers and the adoption of cloud computing and storage as a service in order to manage said data.

                Bio: Piotr Wojciechowski is an Assistant Professor in the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at West Virginia University. Dr. Wojciechowski earned a PhD in Computer Science from West Virginia University in 2019. Dr. Wojciechowski’s research is concerned with the application of concepts from theoretical computer science in artificial intelligence and data science. Problems in both of these fields arise in practical situations. Thus, modeling such problems using constraints and networks is a crucial step towards generating efficient algorithms for these problems and problems in related fields.
