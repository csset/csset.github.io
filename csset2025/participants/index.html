        <br>
        <br>

          

        The general guidelines for posters can be found below. Please note that students must submit their posters April 18, 2025 to print posters for this event. 
        We recommend that you save your poster as a PDF for the submission, and we will print it for you. 

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Poster Development</b>

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your poster written with a lay, non-specialist audience in mind? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is there enough background/contextual information for a non-specialist to understand your work and its significance? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Did you discuss the implications of your research for your field and the community at large? 

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Proofing</b>

        <br>

        &emsp; * Did you proofread your poster, including the headings? 
        <br>
        &emsp; &emsp; Note: MS Word’s spell-check does not check any text in all caps, so you must do it yourself. Another great tool is to use Grammarly. 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Are all the special symbols, tables, and mathematical equations correctly displayed? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Are images properly embedded (not covering up text)? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your name (and the names of any co-authors) listed? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your program listed?

        <br>

        &emsp; * Did you include your title? 

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Specifications</b>

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is the document orientation for your poster set to “portrait”? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your poster size correct (24” X 36”)?

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your file saved as a .pdf file? 

        <br>
